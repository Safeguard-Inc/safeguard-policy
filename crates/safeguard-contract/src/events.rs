//! Typed policy lifecycle events.
//!
//! These events make changes to the compliance configuration itself auditable
//! — they are the difference between "the policy changed" and "we can prove
//! which policy version was active when". `safeguard-audit` consumes them;
//! the event names are part of the stable interface between the polyrepos.
//!
//! Note the boundary: **transfer-level** events (`transfer_approved`,
//! `transfer_blocked`) belong to `safeguard-hooks`, not here.
