//! On-chain evaluation: assemble a core request from contract state.
//!
//! `evaluate` is the read path `safeguard-hooks` calls. It is deliberately
//! side-effect free (no storage writes, no events) and deterministic:
//!
//! 1. Resolve the policy's **active version** record (fail: no active policy).
//! 2. Check the token is **bound** to the policy (fail: not covered).
//! 3. Resolve authoritative facts from the on-chain registries where entries
//!    exist (sanctions match, jurisdiction), falling back to the caller's
//!    claims otherwise.
//! 4. Translate the resolved facts plus the active version's rules into a
//!    [`safeguard_core::evaluation::EvaluationRequest`].
//! 5. Run the core engine and map its decision back into Soroban values.
//!
//! The contract never interprets rule semantics itself — the core engine
//! decides. The contract only owns state, scope and translation.
//!
//! # Input codes
//!
//! [`EvaluationInput`] carries core codes (status/region) or booleans
//! (membership/matches). Unknown status or region codes map to the core
//! `Unknown` variants, whose fail-closed semantics flag rather than approve,
//! so a misbehaving caller cannot widen the outcome by sending junk codes.
